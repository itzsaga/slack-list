        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>This project was originally thought up by <a href="http://sethalexander.me" target="_blank">Seth Alexander</a>, me, the person writing this. After attending the Flatiron School Online Web Developer Program, I worked part-time as a Teaching Assistant for them. I consistently would mention the <a href="https://nashdev.com" taget="_blank">NashDev Slack network</a> and I would consistently be asked by students how they could find similar networks around them. I found my local Slack network as one of the best resources as I started my career in web development. One day I went looking for such a list. I found an amazing one put together by the people over at <a href="https://blog.standuply.com/the-full-list-of-1000-slack-communities-2c412054ea30" target="_blank">Standuply</a>. However, I thought it could be improved if it was pulled off of Medium and curated by the community that makes up the majority of Slack. A lot of us contribute to Open Source so creating an Open Source project to house and maintain such a list just seemed like the right thing to do. It also seemed like a way to have a larger group of people working on this.</p>
    
        <h2>Community from the Start</h2>
        <p>This project started with members of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.nashville/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp Nashville</a> community as the main contributors. We had been looking for a project to work on together and this was a great fit. We hope that you find a network and get plugged in. If there isn't one in your area, start one!</p>
