            , me, the person writing this. After attending the Flatiron School
            Online Web Developer Program, I worked part-time as a Teaching
            Assistant for them. I consistently would mention the{' '}

            and I would consistently be asked by students how they could find
            similar networks around them. I found my local Slack network as one
            of the best resources as I started my career in web development. One
            day I went looking for such a list. I found an amazing one put
            together by the people over at{' '}
            <a
              href="https://blog.standuply.com/the-full-list-of-1000-slack-communities-2c412054ea30"

            . However, I thought it could be improved if it was pulled off of
            Medium and curated by the community that makes up the majority of
            Slack. A lot of us contribute to Open Source so creating an Open
            Source project to house and maintain such a list just seemed like
            the right thing to do. It also seemed like a way to have a larger
            group of people working on this.

            project to work on together and this was a great fit. We hope that
            you find a network and get plugged in. If there isn't one in your
            area, start one!
